Secure, lightweight Rack middleware for Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
endpoints. SNS messages are intercepted, parsed, verified, and then passed along
to the web application via the 'sns.message' environment key. Heroic::SNS has no
dependencies besides Rack (specifically, the aws-sdk gem is not needed).
SNS message signatures are verified in order to reject forgeries and replay
attacks.
