Lightweight Rack middleware for AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) endpoints.
SNS messages are intercepted, parsed, verified, and passed along to the Rack
application in the 'sns.message' environment key. The gem is designed to be
lightweight and does not depend on any other gem besides 'rack' (specifically,
the 'aws-sdk' gem is not required).
